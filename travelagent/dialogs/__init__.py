"""
Dialogs (see aiogram_dialog), which are used in the process of working with the bot.
They are automatically imported from this directory.

Each file consists only of one dialog named the file name + "_dialog".
For example, "start.py" contains "start_dialog".

There may be additional function-handlers in the file.
They should be named as follows:
    - <name>_cmd for commands;
    - <name>_cb for callback queries;
    - <name>_handler for messages and other updates.

There is a logger instance in each file, named "logger".
